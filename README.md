# By: Brady Keppler
Overview: The purpose of this tutorial is to provide information and sources that will help guide you to building or learning about what PC parts are right for your needs.
The target audience is anyone interested in building or buying a PC.

  So you are looking to build or buy a PC, I am here to provide you helpful sources and tips on how to reach your needs. Your first step should be deciding why you want this PC. Ask yourself is it for gaming, browsing, or office work. No matter your answer the first step is always to research. Now also to mention, most of the time when it comes to PC's it is always best to build them. From past experience the price for prebuilt PC's are way more expensive than if you just bought all the parts separately.

# Gaming:
  If your PC needs are for gaming Focus on a powerful GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon), a fast processor (Intel i5/i7 or Ryzen 5/7), and at least 16 GB of RAM. Aim for SSD storage for faster loading. A useful site is [PCPartPicker](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com). This site allows for you to add each part to your virtual PC and see prices and availability.
# Content Creation (Video Editing or 3D Modeling):
  If your PC needs are for video editing, opt for a high-performance CPU, a good GPU, 16-32 GB RAM, and plenty of SSD storage.
# Programming or Software Development
  If your PC needs are for programming, prioritize RAM (16 GB or more), a mid-tier CPU, and dual monitors for multitasking.
# Portability
  If your needs are for something that can be taken on the go the best solution is a Laptop. A laptop can come in many forms, there are gaming laptops and work laptops. You can then connect a laptop to a monitor at home to get a better experience and something more similar to if you had a PC. This is the best option for someone if they need all their files on one device that can be travelled with for presentations or work.
