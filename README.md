# How to figure out what PC is right for you 
# By: Brady Keppler
Overview: The purpose of this tutorial is to provide information and sources that will help guide you to building or learning about what PC parts are right for your needs.
The target audience is anyone interested in building or buying a PC.

  So you are looking to build or buy a PC, I am here to provide you helpful sources and tips on how to reach your needs. Your first step should be deciding why you want this PC. Ask yourself is it for gaming, browsing, or office work. No matter your answer the first step is always to research. Now also to mention, most of the time when it comes to PC's it is always best to build them. From past experience the price for prebuilt PC's are way more expensive than if you just bought all the parts separately. 
# Key Specifications and Information
**_Processor (CPU):_** Intel Core (i3, i5, i7, i9) or AMD Ryzen (3, 5, 7, 9). Match the level to your tasks. _**Graphics Card (GPU):**_ Integrated graphics are fine for light tasks; discrete GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX or AMD Radeon) are essential for gaming and creative work. _**Memory (RAM):**_ 8 GB for general tasks, 16 GB for gaming and multitasking, 32 GB+ for professional workloads. _**Storage:**_ SSD (256 GB - 1 TB) for speed; add HDD (1-2 TB) for mass storage if needed. _**Display:**_ Full HD (1080p) is the minimum; consider 4K for content creation or high-end gaming. _**Ports and Connectivity:**_ Ensure enough USB, HDMI, or Thunderbolt ports for peripherals and accessories.
# Budget:
**Entry-level:** $400–$800; **Mid-range:** $800–$1,500; **High-end:** $1,500+
# Research and Compare
**Brands:** Dell, HP, Lenovo, ASUS, Acer, etc. **Retailers:** Compare prices and configurations at trusted stores like Best Buy, Newegg, or Amazon. **Reviews:** Check online reviews for reliability and performance insights.
# Gaming:
  If your PC needs are for gaming Focus on a powerful GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon), a fast processor (Intel i5/i7 or Ryzen 5/7), and at least 16 GB of RAM. Aim for SSD storage for faster loading. A useful site is [PCPartPicker](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com). This site allows for you to add each part to your virtual PC and see prices and availability.
# Content Creation (Video Editing or 3D Modeling):
  Content creation tasks like video editing, 3D modeling, and animation demand a powerful system. These tasks often require handling large files, real-time rendering, and complex applications (e.g., Adobe Premiere, Blender, Maya). Here’s what to prioritize: 
**CPU:**: Intel i7/i9 or AMD Ryzen 7/9 and 6+ cores for smooth performance.
**GPU:**: NVIDIA RTX Series or AMD Radeon RX Series and 8 GB VRAM or more.
**RAM:**: 16 GB - 32 GB.
**Storage:**: 500 GB - 1 TB SSD (for fast access) and Optional 1-2 TB HDD for extra storage.
**Display:**: 1080p or 4K resolution, IPS panel for better color accuracy, and dual monitors for better productivity.
**Cooling:**: High-quality cooling (air or liquid) and at least 650W power supply (PSU).
# Programming or Software Development
  If you’re focused on programming or software development, the system needs to support tasks like compiling code, running IDEs (Integrated Development Environments), handling databases, and potentially running virtual machines (VMs) or containers. Here’s what to prioritize:
# Portability
  If your needs are for something that can be taken on the go the best solution is a Laptop. A laptop can come in many forms, there are gaming laptops and work laptops. You can then connect a laptop to a monitor at home to get a better experience and something more similar to if you had a PC. This is the best option for someone if they need all their files on one device that can be travelled with for presentations or work.
