# By: Brady Keppler
Overview: The purpose of this tutorial is to provide information and sources that will help guide you to building or learning about what PC parts are right for your needs.
The target audience is anyone interested in building or buying a PC.

  So you are looking to build or buy a PC, I am here to provide you helpful sources and tips on how to reach your needs. Your first step should be deciding why you want this PC. Ask yourself is it for gaming, browsing, or office work. No matter your answer the first step is always to research. Now also to mention, most of the time when it comes to PC's it is always best to build them. From past experience the price for prebuilt PC's are way more expensive than if you just bought all the parts separately. 
# Gaming
  If your PC needs are for gaming Focus on a powerful GPU (NVIDIA GeForce RTX or AMD Radeon), a fast processor (Intel i5/i7 or Ryzen 5/7), and at least 16 GB of RAM. Aim for SSD storage for faster loading. A useful site is [PCPartPicker](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com)
